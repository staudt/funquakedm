Todos:

- 2nd trigger for weapons:
	- spread shots for machine guns
	- molotov for grenade launcher (http://www.inside3d.com/qctut/qctut-81.shtml)
	- Railgun for lighning (return the regular laser to 1st trigger)
	- Axe?
- FIX BUG: Hold alternate trigger for repeated shots (currently it shoots once per click)
- duble tap a direction to dodge
- footstep sounds
